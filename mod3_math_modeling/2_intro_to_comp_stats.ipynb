    "## Definition of Probability\n",
    "In general, a probability is a numerical measure of the chance that a given event happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1, since it's calculated by dividing the number of occurences by the number of all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, fair dice have a $1/6$ chance of rolling a 3 and a fair coin has a $1/2$ chance of landing heads or tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability vs. Likelihood\n",

    "| Probability| The odds of something happening| outcomes| 1/2 chance of a fair coin landing on tails|\n",

    "\n",
    "Our examples from above are both discrete (specifically called probability mass functions), since a die can only land on whole number values and a coin can only land on heads or tails. A continuous example could be the probability density function of a person's height. \n",
