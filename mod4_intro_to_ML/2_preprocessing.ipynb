        "\n",
        "For example, imagine building a model to predict a student‚Äôs grade based on study hours and number of snacks eaten while studying. If you don‚Äôt adjust the scales, the feature with bigger numbers (snacks, possibly in the hundreds!) could outweigh study hours.\n",

        "Many models ‚Äî like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî rely on mathematical distances or optimization processes. When one feature‚Äôs scale is much larger than another‚Äôs, it can dominate these calculations.\n",

        "     $$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n",

        "2. **Min-Max Scaling**  \n",
        "   - In math:  \n",
        "     $$ x' = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} $$\n",
