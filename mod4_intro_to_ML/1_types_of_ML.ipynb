    "\n",
    "A handwriting reader algorithm would be a good application for supervised learning. The labeled data would be images of handwritten text that are labeled with the literal text written. The algorithm would then learn to read handwriting by inputing images, guessing the text, and then changing the model based on whether or not it guessed correctly.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is a framework in which algorithms associate and categorize unlabaled data. It is used for more complex tasks than supervised learning. Instead of mapping from data to labels, it independently finds patterns in unlabeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models are trained by having the model attempt to copy input data, then changing the model so that its outputs more closely match the inputs. For a model that generates text, input text would be fed in, and the model would be changed based on how closely its output matched the input text.\n",

    "Because this framework doesn't require labels, it can identify and exptrapolate more complex relationships from a dataset. It finds whatever associations and connections that exist in the data and mimics them.\n",

They are called deep learning models because they have a larger number of layers of artificial neurons, giving the model 'depth'.
